/**
 * Class Name: InternetServiceProvider
 * Purpose   : To calculate Internet Service Provider customer's monthly bill. 
 *             There are 3 packages for customer
 *             Package A: $9.95 / month with 10 hours access and $2/hour after that.
 *             Package B: $13.95 / month with 20 hours access and $1/hour after that.
 *             Package C: $19.95 / month with unlimited access.
 *             The code should ask user input for package that is used and number of
 *             the hours that are used.
 *             The code then compare the price if the user choose other packages.
 *             The code display the total charges and the comparison for other charges
 *             if other charges are cheaper. If there is no saving, no message should
 *             be printed
