 * Class Name: PenniesForPay
 * Purpose   : To calculate the amount a person would earn over a period of time. 
 *             His / her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day,
 *             and continues to double each day.
 *             The program should display a table showing the salary for each day, and 
 *             then show the total pay at the end of the period.
 *             The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number 
 *             of pennies.
